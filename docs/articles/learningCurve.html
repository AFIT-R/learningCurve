<p>Learning curves are steep in history and have several alternate names such as improvement curves (<a href="http://search.proquest.com/openview/4192c8b3f2e14c8a64ac5c118883aede/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=36911">Fauber, 1989</a>), efficiency curves (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01205997?LI=true">Bjorn, 1998</a>), experience curves (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421512008488">Desroches, Garbesi, Kantner, Buskirk, &amp; Yang, 2013</a>), progress curves (<a href="http://amr.aom.org/content/9/2/235.short">Dutton &amp; Thomas, 1984</a>) and cost improvement curves (<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1941658X.2012.682943">Miller et al., 2012</a>). The “learning effect” was first noted by T.P. Wright in the 1920s in connection with aircraft production (<a href="http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/8.155">Wright, 1936</a>). Its use was amplified by experience in connection with aircraft production in World War II. Initially, it was thought to be solely due to the learning of the workers as they repeated their tasks. Later, it was observed that other factors probably entered in, such as improved tools and working conditions, and various management initiatives. Regardless of the exact, or more likely combined, phenomenon we can group these factors together under the general heading of “learning.”</p>
<p>The underlying notion behind learning curves is that when people individually or collectively repeat an activity, there tends to be a gain in efficiency. Generally, this takes the form of a decrease in the time needed to do the activity. Because cost is generally related to time or labor hours consumed, learning curves are very important in industrial cost analysis. A key idea underlying the theory is that every time the production quantity doubles, we can expect a more or less fixed percentage decrease in the effort required to build a single unit (the Crawford theory), or in the average time required to build a group of units (the Wright theory). These decreases occur not in big jumps, but more or less smoothly as production continues.</p>
<p>Mathematical models are used to represent learning curves by computing the efficiencies gained when an activity is repeated. Today, there are many learning curve models, some of which will be discussed in the next section. The process of capturing or predicting learning curves to assess their influence on future production has been used for many years within the DoD and across industry; in fact, Goldberg &amp; Touw argue that learning curve models are the â€œmost important models in military and industrial cost analysisâ€ (<a href="https://www.cna.org/CNA_files/PDF/D0006870.A3.pdf">2003 p. 1</a>). However, guidance provided to analysts on implementation is limited. Historically, analysts have had to rely on pre-computed tables (<a href="http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_memoranda/RM6191z3.html?src=mobile">Boren &amp; Campbell, 1970</a>) or on their own abilities to create and implement the learning curve functionality (AF Cost Risk and Uncertainty Analysis Handbook, 2008). As previously mentioned, this can result in several deficiencies such as inconsistent and invalid implementation. Thus, although learning curves are a foundational mathematical technique in cost analyses the community lacks an organized construct to distribute, compute, and execute learning curves. This suggests that learning curves represent a valid starting point for establishing an R package; for it yields two utilities: 1) establishes an organized vehicle to distribute and perform learning curve calculations and 2) illustrates the efficacy of open source capabilities for the cost analysis community.</p>

<div id="learning-curve-fundamentals" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<html><body><a href="#learning-curve-fundamentals" class="anchor"> </a></body></html>Learning Curve Fundamentals</h2>
<p>Several learning curve models have been proposed; however, two models represent the most widespread use â€“ Wrightâ€™s cumulative average model and Crawfordâ€™s single unit model. The underlying notion behind the theory of these two models is that every time the production quantity doubles, we can expect an approximate fixed percentage decrease in the effort required to produce a single unit (Crawfordâ€™s theory), or in the average time required to build a group of units (Wrightâ€™s theory).</p>
<p>Both Wrightâ€™s and Crawfordâ€™s model can be expressed as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y_n=ax^b \tag{1}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> represents the time (or cost) to produce the first unit, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> represents the cumulative number of units produced and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> the natural slope of the learning curve where <span class="math inline">\(b = log(s)â„log(2)\)</span>. The primary difference lies in <span class="math inline">\(y_n\)</span>, which for Wrightâ€™s model represents the cumulative average time (or cost) required for the first <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> units and for Crawfordâ€™s model represents the time (or cost) required for the <span class="math inline">\(n^{th}\)</span> unit of production.</p>
<p>The natural slope (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>) reflects whether learning proceeds rapidly or slowly but is not always intuitive. Consequently, the natural slope can be expressed as a percent between 0-100% through algebraic conversion of <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> to obtain <span class="math inline">\(s = 10^{b*log(2)+2}\)</span> which is equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(s = 2^b\)</span>. When expressed as the percent slope (<span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>) we can state that every time production quantity is doubled, the time (or cost) are reduced to s percent of what they were before the doubling.</p>
<div id="unit-model-extensions" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<html><body><a href="#unit-model-extensions" class="anchor"> </a></body></html>Unit Model Extensions</h3>
<p>We may not always have information regarding the first unit. Rather, we may only have time or cost information regarding the <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>th unit (<span class="math inline">\(y_m\)</span>) where <span class="math inline">\(m&lt;n\)</span>. Consequently, for the unit model, we can still compute the time required for the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>th unit by recognizing the relationship <span class="math inline">\(y_n â„ y_m = n^b â„ m^b\)</span> such that the following holds:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y_n=y_m \Big(\frac{n}{m}\Big)^b \tag{2}\]</span></p>
<p>Moreover, the ability to predict the total hours for a block of production is important. Thus the Eq. 3 represents the unit by unit summation where <span class="math inline">\(T_{m,n}\)</span> is the total time (or cost) of production for unit <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> to unit <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(m &lt; n\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ T_{m,n} = a[m^b+(m+1)^b+(m+2)^b+â‹¯+n^b ] \tag{3}\]</span></p>
<p>However, exact summation can be computationally slow when calculating for significantly large production blocks. Consequently, a formulaic approximation to the Eq. 3 can be written as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[T_{m,n} = \Big[\frac{a}{1+b}\Big]*\Big[(n+0.5)^{1+b}-(m-.05)^{1+b} \Big] \tag{4}\]</span></p>
<p>As an example of this approximation’s accuracy, when computing <span class="math inline">\(T_{m,n}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(a=100\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(m=1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(n=1,000,000\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(b=-0.2345\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(s=85%\)</span>) the exact summation produces <span class="math inline">\(T_{m,n}=5,119,612\)</span> and the approximation produces <span class="math inline">\(T_{m,n}=5,119,614\)</span>; a difference of only 2 units.</p>
<p>We can also obtain the hypothetical midpoint of a production block. Considering the number of units in a block is represented as <span class="math inline">\(Q=n-m+1\)</span>, thus leveraging our approximation Eq. 4, we can state that unit <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> represents the average time (or cost) per unit in this block such that <span class="math inline">\(T_{m,n}=y_k * Q\)</span>. We also know that <span class="math inline">\(y_k=ak^b\)</span>; therefore, <span class="math inline">\(T_{m,n}=ak^b Q\)</span>. Hence, since <span class="math inline">\(k=(T_{m,n}â„Qa)^{1/b}\)</span> we can substitute Eq. 3 for <span class="math inline">\(T_{m,n}\)</span> and yield the following:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[k=\Bigg[\frac{(n+0.5)^{1+b}-(m-.05)^{1+b}}{(1+b)(n-m+1)}\Bigg]^{1/b} \tag{5}\]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="cumulative-average-model-extensions" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<html><body><a href="#cumulative-average-model-extensions" class="anchor"> </a></body></html>Cumulative Average Model Extensions</h3>
<p>With the cumulative average model, we can compute total hours (or cost) for a production block from unit 1 to unit <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(T_{1,n}\)</span> with the following:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[T_{1,n} = an^{1+b} \tag{6}\]</span></p>
<p>Furthermore, we can calculate total hours (or cost) for a production block from unit <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> to unit <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(T_{m,n}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(m &lt; n\)</span> with:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[T_{m,n} = T_{1,n}-T_{1,m-1} = a\big[n^{1+b} -(m-1)^{1+b} \big] \tag{7}\]</span></p>
<p>Consequently, we can use the previous equation to derive this next equation, which computes the hours or cost for a particular unit. Consider if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> equals <span class="math inline">\(m+1\)</span>, the previous equation allows us to write <span class="math inline">\(y_n = a\big[n^{1+b}-(n-1)^{1+b}\big]\)</span> and by analogy using the unit model, we can deduce Eq. 8:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y_n = y_m \Bigg[\frac{(n^{1+b}-(n-1)^{1+b}}{m^{1+b}-(m-1)^{1+b}}\Bigg] \tag{8}\]</span></p>
<p>While the unit and cumulative average models are both based on the underlying power law formula, they are quite different in the way they work. Different studies debate the merits and superiority of learning curve methods and additional studies indicate that each methodology provides distinct benefits (i.e. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/095652219190043Z">Jensen, 1991</a>; <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1941658X.2012.682943">Miller, Dowling, Youd, Unger, &amp; White, 2012</a>). The purpose here is not to advocate one or the other but, rather, to outline the fundamentals behind each one. It is also important to understand differences that exist in the predicted outputs between these models. Moreover, both unit and cumulative average models are sensitive to errors in <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. If one errs in the direction of setting <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, and therefore <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, too low the result will be an overrun in the time (or cost). If <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is set too high then time (or cost) will be over-predicted. We can compute the approximate percent error in cumulative time (or cost) due to an incorrect choice of learning rate with Eq. 9 where <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> is the measure of error when the natural learning curve slope <span class="math inline">\(b_2\)</span> is compared to slope <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[e = n^{b_2-b_1 }-1 \tag{9}\]</span></p>
<p>In addition, it is common for large organizations to track learning rates by department. Learning rates typically differ in diverse operations. When these rates are individually tracked, it is possible for each department to have its own learning curve for a given product or process. Estimators then can create separate estimates for each department based on that departmentâ€™s learning profile. However, some analysts (i.e. Contract negotiators) typically deal more with the “big picture.” If the customer wants to change the production quantity, or perhaps make certain other changes, these cost analysts may not have the time to revisit the learning for each department to predict changes in total time (or cost). Rather, they want an aggregated learning curve for the entire firm (across all production or service departments involved in the creation and delivery of the product or service) that is reasonably accurate at any production quantity of the product. Aggregated learning curves can also be useful when learning is applied to both labor and material. Consequently, a simple yet robust method for an aggregate learning curve follows. If we apply the following assumptions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Aggregated first unit time (or cost) across all departments must be equal to the sum of all first unit time (or cost) for each department represented as <span class="math inline">\(a_{1,n}^{all} = âˆ‘_{i=1}^na_i\)</span>
</li>
<li>Aggregated total hours (or cost) across all departments must be equal to the sum of hours (or cost) for each department for the expected production quantity <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> represented as <span class="math inline">\(T_{1,n}^{all}=âˆ‘_{i=1}^nT_{1,n}^i\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then for the cumulative average model we can derive the approximate aggregate cumulative time (or cost) with:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[T_{1,n}^{all} = a_{1,n}^{all}*n^B \tag{10}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is the composite learning slope which can be derived via Eq. 11:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[B = \frac{log(T_{1,n}^{all} - log(a_{1,n}^{all})}{log(n)} \tag{11}\]</span></p>
<p>There are additional algorithms established for learning curve modeling but these represent the most commonly used functions that the authors have applied and witnessed others applying on a routine basis in their cost analysis work. Consequently, these functions provide a good starting point to construct an R package to distribute these algorithms in a means that makes computing and executing them more straightforward and consistent.</p>

<p>To put these functions into action we load the <code>learningCurve</code> package along with the <code>tidyverse</code> package for basic data manipulation purposes:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">library</span>(learningCurve)
<span class="kw">library</span>(tidyverse)</code></pre></div>
<p>To use the unit_curve function we need to supply it with the following arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>t: time (or cost) required for the mth unit of production</li>
<li>n: nth unit you wish to predict the time (or cost) for</li>
<li>r: learning curve rate</li>
<li>m: mth unit of production (the default is set to 1st production unit)</li>
</ul>
<p>So assume an analyst believes that the first unit of a product will require 100 labor hours and the organization has historically experienced an 85% learning curve on similar products. To estimate how many hours the 125th unit will require based on Crawford’s single unit model we apply <code>unit_curve</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw"><a href="../reference/unit_curve.html">unit_curve</a></span>(<span class="dt">t =</span> <span class="dv">100</span>, <span class="dt">m =</span> <span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dt">n =</span> <span class="dv">125</span>, <span class="dt">r =</span> .<span class="dv">85</span>)

<p>Moreover, since R functions are vectorized we can easily compute differences in estimated hours based on different learning rates:</p>

<p>Alternatively, if the analyst wants to estimate the total time (or cost) required for all production units from m to n we can apply the <code>unit_cum_exact</code> function. Going back to our initial example, if an estimator believes the first unit of a product will require 100 hours and the organization has historically experienced an 85% learning curve, we can predict the cumulative time required for the first 125 units:</p>

## [1] 5201.085</code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively, we can apply the <code>unit_cum_appx</code> function to compute the approximate cumulative total hours, which typically falls within 1% of the exact cumulative time produced by <code>unit_cum_exact</code>.</p>

<p>The primary difference between <code>unit_cum_exact</code> and <code>unit_cum_appx</code> is computational efficiency.

<p>To obtain the hypothetical midpoint of a production block we leverage the <code>unit_midpoint</code> function. An analyst that needs to know the midpoint for a production block that runs from unit 201 to unit 500 inclusive with a projected learning curve of 75% can obtain this with:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw"><a href="../reference/unit_midpoint.html">unit_midpoint</a></span>(<span class="dt">m =</span> <span class="dv">201</span>, <span class="dt">n =</span> <span class="dv">500</span>, <span class="dt">r =</span> .<span class="dv">75</span>)
## [1] 334.6103</code></pre></div>
<p>Moreover, the analyst can easily produce a summary for the production block such as total block units, total block hours, midpoint unit and midpoint hours with <code>unit_block_summary</code>. The arguments required include:</p>
<ul>
<li>t: time (or cost) required for the mth unit of production</li>
<li>m: lower bound unit of production block</li>
<li>n: upper bound unit of production block</li>
<li>r: learning curve rate</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, with our previous example, the analyst can obtain the block summary for units 201 to 500 inclusive with a projected learning curve of 75% and an estimate time of 125 hours for the mth unit with:</p>

<p>To assess the unit learning with Wright’s cumulative average model we use <code>ca_unit</code>. To illustrate we can use the same inputs as with the Crawford model where the first unit of a product will require 100 labor hours and the organization has historically experienced an 85% <em>cumulative average learning curve</em> (rather than a unit level learning rate as is the case with Crawford’s model) on similar products. To estimate how many hours the 125th unit will require we apply the following:</p>

## [1] 24.70136</code></pre></div>
<p>By using <code>plot_unit_curve</code> we can plot Wright’s learning curve for this block by changing the <code>model</code> argument to <code>model = "ca"</code>:</p>

<p>and also plot the learning curve for this total curve with <code>plot_unit_curve</code> by changing the model argument to model = “ca” and the level argument to level = “c” for computing cumulative hours rather than unit hours:</p>

<p>There may be instances where there is confusion on whether the a quoted learning curve slope is based on Wright’s versus Crawford’s theory. As the analyst you need to understand the behavior and impact that this confusion may have.

<p>We may also be concerned about the difference in predicted time (or cost) due to selecting an inaccurate learning curve. <code>cum_error</code> computes the approximate percent error in cumulative hours (or cost) due to an incorrect choice of learning curve. For example, assume an analyst is predicting hours for a block of 250 units on a particular product. Historically, the organization has had learning rates as low as 85% and as high as 87% on similar products. What is the potential error in the analysts prediction? If the analyst selects a learning rate of 85% (<em>r1</em>) and the organization performs at a learning rate of 87% (<em>r2</em>) then the cumulative error would be approximately 20%.</p>

The first unit hours for these departments for the widget have been estimated at 70, 45, and 25 and an analyst is expected to compute the composite learning curve hours for the entire effort.

Consider the case when an analyst needs to compute the historical natural slope for a production block that consisted of 250 units where the time for unit 1 took 80 hours and the total time for all 250 units took 8,250 hours.</p>

<p>Likewise, the learning rate can be computed for the same example using <code>lc_rate_est</code>:</p>

<p>It is also important to note that the plotting functions are built on top of the very popular <a href="http://ggplot2.org/">ggplot2</a> R visualization package. This means the analyst can easily modify the visualization by adding new lines of ggplot2 code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">subtitle &lt;-<span class="st"> "The difference in cumulative hours produced by the Crawford and Wright model when the first unit </span><span class="ch">\n</span><span class="st">is estimated to take 100 hours, the expected learning rate is 85%, and total units produced is 25 is </span><span class="ch">\n</span><span class="st">estimated to be 305 hours."</span>
