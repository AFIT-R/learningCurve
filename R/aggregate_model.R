#' Aggregate Learning Curve
#'
#' @description Computes the approximate aggregate cumulative learning curve formula by calculating the sum of all contributing hours from all departments for all production units 1 through n.
#' 
#' @param t vector of hours (or costs) for the first unit from departments 1 through m
#' @param n total units to be produced across all departments
#' @param r vector of historical learning rates for departments 1 through m
#' @param na.rm Should \code{NA} values be removed?
#'
#' @examples
#' # A project is expected to get underway soon to produce 300
#' # widgets. Three departments will be involved. Historically,
#' # these departments have had learning curves of 85%, 87%, and
#' # 80% respectively. The first unit hours for these departments
#' # have been estimated at 70, 45, and 25 respectively. What is 
#' # the total predicted hours required for the entire effort?
#' 
#' t <- c(70, 45, 25)
#' r <- c(.85, .87, .8)
#' 
#' agg_curve(t = t, r = r, n = 300)
#' ## [1] 11000.96
