#' Aggregate Learning Curve
#'
#' @description Computes the approximate aggregate cumulative learning curve formula by calculating the sum of all contributing hours from all departments for all production units 1 through n.
#' 
#' @param t vector of hours (or costs) for the first unit from departments 1 through m
#' @param n total units to be produced across all departments
#' @param r vector of historical learning rates for departments 1 through m
