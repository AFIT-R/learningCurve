Title: An Implementation of Crawford's and Wright's Learning Curve Production Functions
Version: 1.1.2
Description: Implements common learning curve production functions. It incorporates
    Crawford's and Wright's learning curve functions to compute unit and cumulative 
    block estimates for time (or cost) of units along with an aggregate learning 
    curve. It also provides delta and error functions and some basic learning curve 
    plotting functions.along with functions to compute aggregated learning curves, 
    error rates, and to visualize learning curves.
