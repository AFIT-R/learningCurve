\title{Crawford vs. Wright Delta Plot}
\usage{
plot_delta(t, m, n, r, level = "u")
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{time (or cost) required to produce the mth unit}

\item{m}{mth unit for which you have time (or cost) information (default is m = 1)}

\item{n}{the nth unit you wish to predict the time (or cost) for when comparing unit predictions or the last unit in the block when comparing cumulative time (or costs)}

\item{r}{learning curve rate}

\item{level}{plot the delta between the Crawford and Wright models at the unit ("u") or cumulative ("c") level}
}
\description{
Plots the delta of hours (or cost) per unit between Crawford's unit model and Wright's cumulative average model.
}
\examples{
# The first unit of production is expected to require 50 hours and
# the learning rate is expected to be 88.5\%. However, the estimator
# is not sure whether the learning rate is based on the unit model
# or cumulative average model and wants to understand the difference
# between potential outcomes for each unit.  

# Plot the differences between per unit time requirements
plot_delta(t = 50, m = 1, n = 25, r = .885)

# Plot the differences between cumulative time requirements
plot_delta(t = 50, m = 1, n = 25, r = .885, level = "c")
