\title{Natural Slope Estimate}
\usage{
natural_slope_est(T, t, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{T}{total time (or cost) required to produce the first n units}

\item{t}{time (or cost) required to produce the first unit}

\item{n}{total n units produced}
}
\description{
Computes the natural slope based on total time (cost) to produce the first n units, time (cost) required for the first unit and total units produced.
}
\examples{
 
# Estimate the natural slope for 250 units when the time for unit
# one took 80 hours and the total time for all 250 units took
# 8,250 hours.
